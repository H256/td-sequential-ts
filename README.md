# TD Sequential in TS

TD Sequential indicator in Typescript

Experiment to port [this](https://github.com/ourarash/tdsequential) repo to typescript and make it compatible with
CCXT's _fetchOHLCV()_ - method's response.

To use, simply clone and `import { TDSequential } from 'build/main/index' That should do.

Thanks got out to [ourarash](https://github.com/ourarash) for his initial effort to implement this.
